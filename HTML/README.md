## Working of any website

* A client or a user sends a request to the webserver of the website he wants to visit.

* The webserver has its own domain name or IP address, stores all the files in the backend which can be written in JAVA, PHP, PYTHON or Node.js.

* The web server sends a response to the client in the form of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
